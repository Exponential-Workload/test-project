# About this Template

This is a template for a SvelteKit project. It contains a basic ChatGPT-Clone Chat Application.<br/>
It's suggested you remove this from the README upon starting your project.

If you're seeing this, you likely just generated a project based on it! If you're not sure what to do next, check out the [SvelteKit Documentation](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/introduction) or the [Svelte Documentation](https://svelte.dev/docs) (if you're new to Svelte).

If you want a blank template, remove the following directories:
- `/src/routes/(app)/`
- `/src/lib/*`
